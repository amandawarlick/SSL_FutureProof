## Abstract

Designing effective monitoring programs is fundamental to ascertaining information about wildlife population dynamics with a level of precision that can inform conservation goals and management decisions. However, the trade-offs between survey effort, data quality, and survey costs are oftentimes not rigorously examined prior to initiating a monitoring program. In this study, we present a simulation analysis examining the precision of survival estimates and the probability of detecting a change in survival using a mark-resight model framework across a range of survey features, including the size of the marked population, marking frequency, detection probability, and study duration. Our results highlight numerous survey designs that reliably meet target precision thresholds, though marked cohort size, marking frequency, and study duration were most influential in improving precision, compensating for other “losses” of information to a degree that increasing detection probability did not. We examine these findings in the context of a Steller sea lion (*Eumetopias jubatus*) case study, where efforts to implement an effective monitoring program that can provide insights into the drivers of divergent trends in abundance have been challenged by the heterogeneity of rookery accessibility, breeding population sizes, and abundance trends across the species’ expansive range. We found that historical mark-resight survey effort for Steller sea lions has been sufficient to reliably achieve precision targets for younger age classes only for rookeries where abundance trends are stable or increasing. Where abundance trends continue to decline, the probability of achieving precise survival estimates for certain age classes is low, constrained by the smaller marked cohort sizes and fewer years of available data that are characteristic of these subpopulations. Though our results indicate that the precision of survival estimates can be greatly increased by investing in building and maintaining longer study horizons, the constraints of smaller, declining, remote rookeries may dampen the ability of this and other similar monitoring programs to enhance survey efforts in response to changing management needs. Our findings emphasize the importance of evaluating model performance in the context of specific management targets, conservation goals, and risk thresholds. The simulation framework and results presented here are useful across diverse applications and could assist natural resource managers in planning and executing effective monitoring programs that address pressing and emerging conservation questions.
